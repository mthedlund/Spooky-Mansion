Helpful Explanations

For the time, if the player enters "time" it will tell them excactly how many minutes and 
seconds they have been playing the game for.

For the locked doors task I was able to do the first part, and make all of the locked doors
detectable. However, I was unable to make it so the user could only enter the door if they 
had the necessary key.

For the cats task, the player must type in "cat" for the cat to start roaming around. After this
the cat changes rooms every 10 seconds and if the cat is in the same room as the player a message
telling the player this shows up.

For the giant switch I created a teleporter room in the basement. The teleporter room randomly 
teleports the player to one of the 6 main rooms around the mansion. It also has a 1/7 chance to 
teleport the player to the moon, which is not accessible any other way, for an easter egg ending. 
This ending is hinted at when the player first enters the room.
